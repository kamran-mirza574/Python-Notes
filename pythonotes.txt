Problem 1: Dictionary Manipulation
Write a Python program to perform the following tasks:

Create an empty dictionary called student_scores.
Prompt the user to enter the names of three students and their corresponding scores.
Store the student names as keys and their scores as values in the student_scores dictionary.
Print out the name and score of each student in the dictionary.

Problem 2: Tuple Operations
Write a Python program to do the following:

Create a tuple called dimensions that contains the dimensions of a rectangle in the format (length, width).
Calculate and print the area of the rectangle.
Prompt the user to enter new dimensions for the rectangle.
Update the dimensions tuple with the new values provided by the user.
Calculate and print the area of the rectangle with the updated dimensions.

Problem 3: Dictionary and Tuple Combination
Write a Python program to perform the following tasks:

Create a dictionary called inventory with items as keys and their quantities as values.
Create a tuple called new_items that contains items and quantities to be added to the inventory in the format [(item1, quantity1), (item2, quantity2), ...].
Update the inventory dictionary to include the new items and quantities from the new_items tuple.
Print out the updated inventory.

Problem 4: Dictionary Filtering
Write a Python program to filter a dictionary based on a given condition:

Create a dictionary called scores with student names as keys and their scores as values.
Prompt the user to enter a threshold score.
Create a new dictionary called passed_students that includes only the students whose scores are equal to or greater than the threshold score entered by the user.
Print out the names and scores of the students who passed.
